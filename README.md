# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
-On this challenge unfortunately, I did not start with mobile first work flow. I started by creating the markup using css to style. I started with the normal layout and I later designed for screens with a maximum of 375px width.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learnt how to use flxe-box more
- I learnt and understood the importance of using mobile-first flow method as its much easier and efficient
- I also managed to design for media screens with max width of 375. 

### Challenges
- I was not able to design the button exactly according to the designs from frontEndMentor.

### Continued development

I will teach my-self on how to use css grid and try to use mobile first workflow on the next challenge.


### Useful resources

- [HTML and CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-h8L5hgW-w) - This helped me understand the importance of mobile first workflow. I really liked his pattern and will use it going forward.
